# Pie chart image filter
this is a program made in processing which takes in an image and turns it into a picture that is made entirely of little pie charts!
The size of the pies is determined by the brightness of the coresponding segment of the picture, and the ratio of the sections represents the amount of red, green and blue that the average colour in that area has.

Here is a video showing what the results look like: https://vimeo.com/152035442
